### QUICK DOCS
**Flex Layout**\
A layout style spanning 4 columns looks like this `.grd-span-4-xld`\
Raku layout gives you only four base layout options `.grd-span-[1,2,3,4]-xld`\
Easy right? the explanation\
`.grd-` - denotes the flex display\
`span-` - just a reminder of what the next number means\
`4-` - how many columns for child elements\
`xld` - the display ex. 1280px and above
